# Code reading report for pl0 compiler in c

pl0 is a rather simple procedural language, without OO features. 

Pl0 implement features: 

â€‹	constant and mutable integer variables, simple arithmetic expression, variable assignment, procedures(function without return value)

Codes are organized in two files pl0.c, pl0.h, respectively 1353 lines and 135 lines.

pl0.h contains some function declarations and struct definitions. Functions are implemented in pl0.c.

communications between functions are implemented by lots of global variables in pl0.h

The executable should be given a pl0 source file as input. 

Output contains symbol table, three address codes, the executing result of the pl0 program(if input are provided).

getch(): get a new char from source file

getsym(): manually simulate a DFA, finish lexical analysis.

interpret(): interpret the three address code stored in array `code []`
